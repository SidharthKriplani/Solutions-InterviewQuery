def get_last_node(head):
    if not head:
        return None

    current_node = head

    while current_node['next'] is not None:
        current_node = current_node['next']
    
    return current_node

(I had no idea what a singly linked list is but this question is very good to understand that. Basically a singly linked list is a list of nodes that run in a single direction, the first node is called the head, the last node points to NULL. Every node has a pointer and a data element. We can modify data elements from end/beginning/anywhere at all
to represent a singly linked list in python we use nested dictionaries containing a data key and a pointer key; data key has the data as the item, pointer key points to the next node as an item
this question just wants to find the last node, so it is easy, I did chatgpt the solution since my python was very weak then)
